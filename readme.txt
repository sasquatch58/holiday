The Holiday module uses the PEAR library for calculating holidays.  
Additionally, it features a whitelist & blacklist for adding custom holidays 
based on additional requirements, etc.  The goal is to allow for more 
advanced calculation of workhours and project dates, etc.

The original version of this module was developed by Vegard Fiksdal
